# Backlog

One entry per task, stable id in front; a long entry may wrap onto indented lines. `[ ]` open, `[~]`
in progress (exactly one, in `## Now`, matching `plan/SESSION.md`), `[x]` done and in `## Done` with
the commit that closed it. Older entries are kept as a short tail so the current position reads at a
glance.

The `files:` hint names where the work starts and is required on every unfinished task: each path
must exist, so name a directory for a file the task creates. The hint is a hint, not a boundary: read
those files and their callers, not the workspace.

Order is the order of work. Renumbering is not allowed; a new task takes the next free id in its
phase. Phases come from the shape-base plan: A contour, B contour operations, C sketch, D panel
variants, E 2D primitives, F revolution and sweep, G 2D booleans, H hardware and accessories; P is
the plan and `xtask` itself, L is scene lighting, S is a structural refactor that changes module
boundaries only, X is a defect in behaviour that already shipped, and U is the UI: toolbars, drawing
tools, view controls and icon resources.

A defect is filed under `## Bugs` with an `X` id next to the feature that owns it. Its entry states
the observation, the expectation and the suspected cause, and never a guess at a fix that has not
been reproduced. Taking it moves the line into `## Now` at its place in the work order, so `STATE` can
name it; fixing it moves it to `## Done` with the commit, like any task.

## Now

- `[~]` **U15** the drawing tools: line and polyline, an arc through three points, a rectangle and a
  circle, each producing a `Path`; tests per tool.
  `files: crates/ui/src, crates/model/src/contour.rs`

## Bugs

- `[ ]` **X2** a valid contour with more than 1024 sampled points cannot become an extrusion.
  Observed: the command now refuses it with "one extrusion cap holds at most 1024", where before
  A6 it was stored and drew nothing. Expected: any simple ring the user can draw becomes a solid.
  Cause: one extrusion cap is one document face, capped by `MAX_FACE_VERTICES`; the ring samples at
  50 µm, so a smooth ring of a few turns exceeds it while the ring itself is legal (at most 256
  segments). `object.collapse` fails on such an object and `object_mesh` cannot draw it.
  `files: crates/param/src/lib.rs, crates/model/src/object.rs`

## Next

- `[ ]` **U16** the viewport preview: the draft segments, the snap marker and a live size, with the
  tool owning the pointer and the gizmos hidden.
  `files: apps/furnicraft/src/main.rs, apps/furnicraft/src/contour_gizmo.rs`
- `[ ]` **U17** commit a drawn path: `object.path.create` with a placement whose local XY is the work
  plane, the new node selected and the tool reset; exactly one undo entry.
  `files: crates/ui/src, crates/engine/src/object_cmds.rs`
- `[ ]` **U18** themed toolbars: a left strip whose panels group the tools by theme, an icon button
  with a tooltip and a shortcut, and a text label while an icon is empty; the state lives in `Editor`.
  `files: crates/ui/src/lib.rs, crates/ui/src/scene_tree.rs`
- `[ ]` **U19** fill the panels: Contour (line, polyline, arc, rectangle, circle), Scene (panel,
  assembly, camera, light), Primitives (cube) and Bodies (extrude).
  `files: crates/ui/src/lib.rs, crates/ui/src/scene_tree.rs`
- `[ ]` **U20** remove every creation button and menu entry from the scene tree and `TreeAction`, so
  the tree only shows and restructures nodes.
  `files: crates/ui/src/scene_tree.rs, crates/ui/src/lib.rs`
- `[ ]` **U21** a primitive from its panel: the cube is created at the click point on the work plane,
  with the size field of the panel.
  `files: crates/ui/src, apps/furnicraft/src/main.rs`
- `[ ]` **U22** cylinder and sphere: `Mesh::cylinder` and `Mesh::sphere` in the model, the matching
  `PrimitiveKind` variants and the panel buttons.
  `files: crates/model/src/mesh.rs, crates/engine/src/object_cmds.rs`
- `[ ]` **U23** extrude a selected closed path into a body with `object.extrude.create` and a height
  field; an open path is refused with a readable message.
  `files: crates/ui/src, crates/engine/src/object_cmds.rs`
- `[ ]` **S4** revision-keyed evaluation cache: `(Revision, Id)` to evaluated body and mesh in
  `furnicraft-mesh`; `scene_build` and `object.collapse` share one evaluator and a rebuild touches
  only changed nodes.
  `files: crates/mesh/src/lib.rs, apps/furnicraft/src/scene_build.rs, crates/engine/src/session.rs`
- `[ ]` **P1** `cargo xtask status` prints `head <hash>` and, while `state=doing`, the note's
  `task`/`now`/`blocked`/`run` block, so an interrupted session resumes in one command.
  `files: state-contract/src/status.rs, xtask/src/main.rs`
- `[ ]` **P2** `updated=` must be `YYYY-MM-DD` and no earlier than the date of the `base` commit.
  `files: state-contract/src/validate.rs`
- `[ ]` **P3** the current task must be the first unfinished one in `## Now`; promote the rule into
  the gate once the backlog has settled. `files: state-contract/src/validate.rs`

## Done

- `[x]` **U14** a drawing draft in the UI: `DrawDraft` collects plane points, undoes the last
  action, closes into a ring and converts to a `Path`, with the document untouched — `307d745`
- `[x]` **U13** snapping on the work plane: a draft end, an axis lock and the 10 mm grid as pure
  functions, with deterministic ties and table tests — `6d64dc7`
- `[x]` **U12** the work plane: `WorkPlane` maps the pointer onto XY, XZ or YZ from the six standard
  ortho views, world XY otherwise, with a strip label — `6c61962`
- `[x]` **U11** orthographic ↔ perspective as view state: `Camera::toggle_projection` keeps the
  visible height, the strip has a button and `O`, and an authored camera is untouched — `c195d45`
- `[x]` **U10** shape constructors: `Path::rectangle` from two corners, `Path::circle` as four
  quarter arcs and `Path::arc_through`, with degenerate input refused — `13c90b3`
- `[x]` **U9** `object.path.create` and `object.path.replace`, one undo entry each, with ADR 0048 and
  the path payload in the geometry document — `546fb28`
- `[x]` **U8** pick a path: `SceneFrame::pick` measures the ray-to-segment closest approach and
  returns a document `Id` within six viewport points, through one shell helper — `7c544a5`
- `[x]` **U7** draw a stored path: a `Polyline` line primitive in the scene frame, the renderer's
  shared line pipeline, and the shell's sampling of a `Path` into a chain with its bounds — `9ce56be`
- `[x]` **U6** a path object: `Geometry::Path(Path)` at schema 17, with `Project::object_path` and
  `Project::set_object_path`, its chain extents in the node bounds, and older files still
  loading — `847cbbb`
- `[x]` **U5** `Path::to_contour`: a path becomes the ring a panel or an extrusion needs only when it
  is closed and simple, otherwise a readable error — `1c74ea5`
- `[x]` **U4** a flat contour value: `Path` is an ordered chain of line and arc segments with stable
  ids, open or closed, at least one segment, joints meeting within a micrometre and one chain per
  path; tests for a single segment, an arc, an open polyline and a broken joint — `25e330f`
- `[x]` **U25** the contour icon set: `line`, `polyline` and `arc` as flat constructions with
  control points, `rectangle` from two opposite corners, `circle` from its centre, `close` as an
  open chain joined by a heavy segment and `cancel` as the service X; every file reads at 16 px on
  the 24 grid — `d122b85`
- `[x]` **U3** UI scale: a 75–200 % slider in the viewport strip bound to `ctx.set_zoom_factor`, so
  icons are rasterised at the new pixel size instead of stretched, and egui's keyboard zoom stays
  visible in the slider — `152a514`
- `[x]` **U2** icon resources and icon buttons: `egui_extras` with the `svg` feature embeds
  `assets/icons/**` as one module per theme; the shell installs the SVG loader, and `icon_button`
  draws at a fixed 16 pt tinted with the theme text colour, falling back to its text label while an
  asset is empty — `2b453a0`
- `[x]` **U24** the icon contract: one ink on a 24 grid, three families (geometry, view, service), the
  service grammar and its `actions` theme, ADR 0047, and `AGENTS.md` §4.12 plus the `draw-icon` skill
  so the guide is read only while an icon is drawn or edited — `e473342`
- `[x]` **U1** the icon resource tree: `assets/icons/` with one directory per toolbar theme and one
  zero-byte SVG per icon (contour, primitives, bodies, scene, view — 21 placeholders), plus
  `assets/README.md` with the naming, the 24 × 24 grid, the geometry-only format and the empty-file
  fallback — `19fbb49`
- `[x]` **D7** the panel card lists and edits machining from the descriptor table: common operation
  chrome (fold, kind and anchor, reorder, remove) with a section module per kind, an add menu built
  from `MACHINING_DESCRIPTORS` and grouped by category, diagnostics naming a `MachiningId` shown with
  their operation while the Diagnostics section keeps the panel-wide ones, and the open rows kept as
  card view state — `b067bc4`
- `[x]` **D6** the machining pipeline: `CompileMachining` and `OpEffect` (cut region, subtract, add,
  attachment), a `PanelPlan` that folds operations, and a static descriptor table with kind,
  category, stage, capabilities and default; the panel builder contains no kind match, and a
  post/deform stage stays reserved for the deferred bend — `0f1a58a`
- `[x]` **D5** a typed machining list: ordered `Machining` records with stable `MachiningId`s, a
  tagged `MachiningParams` and shared face/edge anchors; `panel.machining.add/update/remove/move`
  replace `cutout.create`, schema 16 writes the record form while legacy cutout entries still load —
  `d87a726`
- `[x]` **D4** one panel outline source: a rectangle keeps its corner and bow parameters as a contour
  generator, a contour panel stores the ring, both produce a `geom::Region`; `PanelGeometry` derives
  core and overall from the region, and no machining code branches on the outline kind —
  `67ccca2`
- `[x]` **G2** exact 2D region booleans on `Contour` rings: union, difference and intersection, used
  to union through cutouts and subtract them from the core instead of the rectangle-only tracer;
  `geom::region` traces the boundary of the set and keeps rings exact — `a0a8e94`
- `[x]` **G1** `geom::Region` holds exact `Contour` rings (outer and holes): rectangle constructor,
  bounds, area, containment and sampling, with the rectangle boolean helpers still passing — `c3c00a4`
- `[x]` **S3** one contour conversion: `crates/param/src/profile.rs` turns a document ring into an
  analytic contour, a sampled `geom::Region` and a `kernel::Profile`; the rectangular core, shaped
  core, cutout tool and constructive extrusion share one sampler and one chord tolerance, and
  `Contour::new_with_tolerance` accepts the one-micrometre joint a stored ring can close to — `82bd63b`
- `[x]` **A7** the contour panel and the contour edit mode are written down in `docs/domain/` and
  ADR 0042: the outline variant, the anchored ring, ring banding, the cutout ring rules and the
  working-copy edit mode — `020a6cb`
- `[x]` **S2** one domain-free solid plan: `SolidPlan` is a base extrusion plus boolean steps, a
  `PlanBuilder` assembles it, and one evaluator drives both the kernel and the analytic
  single-extrusion backend; panels, bands, cutout tools and constructive objects compile to it,
  `object.collapse` keeps the exact mesh, and ADR 0041 records the boundary — `bd33056`
- `[x]` **S1** decompose `crates/model/src/lib.rs` by responsibility: one module per value family,
  panel rules split into geometry, banding and machining, `Project` split into wire, error, derived
  queries and command families, tree traversal in one place; public API, serde and behaviour
  unchanged — `43583b4`
- `[x]` **D3** a cutout by an arbitrary contour: `CutoutShape::Contour`, kept inside the core, through
  and blind, the tool built by extruding the sampled ring; the schema moves to 14 — `2167e2b`
- `[x]` **D2** the contour panel card: the ring summary, the material-driven thickness, the material
  and one banding row per ring segment through `panel.ring_banding.set`/`clear`, no corners, bows or
  cutouts, an `Edit contour` entry; a missing ring-band material is a diagnostic — `f88a995`
- `[x]` **A6** contour edit commands: `panel.outline.set` and `object.contour.replace` share their
  `enabled` check with `run`, validate the ring before the document changes, and record one undo
  entry per apply; a contour too detailed for one extrusion cap is refused instead of stored — `6f3e82b`
- `[x]` **X1** a concave contour cap drew a flap triangle across the notch: `object_mesh` fanned
  every face, so the cap of an extruded object left its own contour; faces are ear-clipped now —
  `a2859fc`
- `[x]` **A3** the contour edit mode: enter on a panel outline or an object contour, edit a working copy
  in the viewport with handles and a preview, leave by applying one command or by cancelling — `1428441`
- `[x]` **A5** contour edit math: move a corner, trim, split, and rely on the segment ring — `dda986c`
- `[x]` **D1** a panel whose outline is a contour ring, banding per ring segment — `d9827ed`
- `[x]` **A4** stable ids for contour segments — `ea3153a`
- `[x]` **A2** contour as a ring of segments — `0833b4c`
- `[x]` **A1** the contour segment type — `e7551ca`
